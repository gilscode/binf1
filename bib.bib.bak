  abstract = {The Monod equation has been extensively used for modeling microbial growth, but has no mechanistic basis and its derivation is purely empirical. In this work an approach was developed for deriving the Monod equation based on a simple kinetics scheme. The microbial growth process considered involved two consecutive steps, i.e., (i) the formation of a substrate-cell ``complex'', and (ii) the metabolism of the substrate for cell reproduction. By departing from the law of mass action, the approach uses a singular perturbation method for derivation of the differential equations governing the microbial growth dynamics. Within this context, a Monod equation corrected by a quadratic term induced by auto-catalyst effects was obtained. The proposed model was validated with experimental data reported in the literature for the degradation of benzene, phenol and toluene by P. putida.},

  abstract = {Precision and personalized medicine will be increasingly based on the integration of various type of information, particularly electronic health records and genome sequences. The availability of cheap genome sequencing services and the information interoperability will increase the role of online bioinformatics analysis. Being on the Internet poses constant threats to security and privacy. While we are connected and we share information, websites and internet services collect various types of personal data with or without the user consent. It is likely that genomics will merge with the internet culture of connectivity. This process will increase incidental findings, exposure and vulnerability. Here we discuss the social vulnerability owing to the genome and Internet combined security and privacy weaknesses. This urges more efforts in education and social awareness on how biomedical data are analysed and transferred through the internet and how inferential methods could integrate information from different sources. We propose that digital social platforms, used for raising collective awareness in different fields, could be developed for collaborative and bottom-up efforts in education. In this context, bioinformaticians could play a meaningful role in mitigating the future risk of digital-genomic divide.},

  abstract = {In Rat-1 fibroblasts nonmitogenic doses of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulate a transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whereas mitogenic doses elicit a sustained response. This sustained phase of MAPK activation regulates cell fate decisions such as proliferation or differentiation, presumably by inducing a program of gene expression which is not observed in response to transient MAPK activation. We have examined the expression of members of the AP-1 transcription factor complex in response to stimulation with different doses of LPA. c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB are induced rapidly in response to LPA stimulation, whereas Fra-1 and Fra-2 are induced after a significant lag. The expression of c-Fos is transient, whereas the expression of c-Jun, JunB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 is sustained. The early expression of c-Fos can be reconstituted with nonmitogenic doses of LPA, but the response is transient compared to that observed with mitogenic doses. In contrast, expression of Fra-1, Fra-2, and JunB and optimal expression of c-Jun are observed only with doses of LPA which induce sustained MAPK activation and DNA synthesis. LPA-stimulated expression of c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, and JunB is inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059, indicating that the Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade is required for their expression. In cells expressing a conditionally active form of Raf-1 ({$\Delta$}Raf-1:ER), we observed that selective, sustained activation of Raf-MEK-MAPK was sufficient to induce expression of Fra-1, Fra-2, and JunB but, interestingly, induced little or no c-Fos or c-Jun. The induction of c-Fos observed in response to LPA was strongly inhibited by buffering the intracellular [Ca2+]. Moreover, although Raf activation or calcium ionophores induced little c-Fos expression, we observed a synergistic induction in response to the combination of {$\Delta$}Raf-1:ER and ionomycin. These results suggest that kinetically distinct phases of MAPK activation serve to regulate the expression of distinct AP-1 components such that sustained MAPK activation is required for the induced expression of Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, and JunB. However, in contrast to the case for Fra-1, Fra-2, and JunB, activation of the MAPK cascade alone is not sufficient to induce c-Fos expression, which rather requires cooperation with other signals such as Ca2+mobilization. Finally, the identification of the Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, and JunB genes as genes which are selectively regulated by sustained MAPK activation or in response to activated Raf suggests that they are candidates to mediate certain of the effects of Ras proteins in oncogenic transformation.},

However standard logo plots primarily highlight enrichment of symbols, and may fail to highlight interesting depletions. Current alternatives that try to highlight depletion often produce visually cluttered logos.
Results: We introduce a new sequence logo plot, the EDLogo plot, that highlights both enrichment and depletion, while minimizing visual clutter. We provide an easy-to-use and highly customizable R package Logolas to produce a range of logo plots, including EDLogo plots. This software also allows elements in the logo plot to be strings of characters, rather than a single character, extending the range of applications beyond the usual DNA, RNA or protein sequences. And the software includes new Empirical Bayes methods to stabilize estimates of enrichment and depletion, and thus better highlight the most significant patterns in data. We illustrate our methods and software on applications to transcription factor binding site motifs, protein sequence alignments and cancer mutation signature profiles.
Conclusions: Our new EDLogo plots and flexible software implementation can help data analysts visualize both enrichment and depletion of characters (DNA sequence bases, amino acids, etc.) across a wide range of applications.},

Computational biologists and other scientists involved in genomic research need to be constantly cognizant of the push and pull of these two important concepts. Clinical genomics research in particular raises a number of particularly poignant concerns as society struggles between invasions of privacy such as recent efforts by the FBI and the NSA, and our own (surprisingly) personal disclosures on social media sites or via apathetic acquiescence to large data collection efforts. With regard to privacy there are numerous computational efforts that have heretofore offered to provide both the robustness of protection and the ease of use to be effective in manipulating the terabytes of data before the genomics researcher. Unfortunately algorithms alone have thus far failed to provide either the necessary strength to foil those intent on obtaining information or the promised agility to manipulate the vast datasets. While technical solutions advance, they cannot stand on their own and this paper proposes and outlines a licensing scheme, similar to those used by professional organizations, that not only enforce a code of conduct and punish those who fail to live up to that code, but also mandate required continuing education to limit the possibility that the code will be violated inadvertently. It is the use of the social and the technological advances together that will likely create not only an environment that fosters research and innovation, but also one that is responsive to privacy needs and norms.},

We also investigate the nature of confirmation biases in using sequence logos in result reporting in publications. While sequence logos have been widely used for visualizing sequence motifs in the past 20 years, no study has reported its effectiveness and possible misuses in decision making. We conducted a paper-and-pencil test to determine the effectiveness of sequence logos in some of their common usages. A survey study was also performed to investigate sequence logos' learn ability. We found that there are great mismatches between users' perception and actual quality of motifs when sequence logos were used as an evaluation metric. Therefore, evaluation of motif prediction tools based on sequence logos has to be interpreted cautiously. Our result also suggests that there are still room for improvements in the current sequence logo's layout design.},

  abstract = {The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is a major determinant in the control of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility. This pathway is often up-regulated in human tumors and as such represents an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs. Because of its multiple roles in the acquisition of a complex malignant phenotype, specific blockade of the ERK pathway is expected to result in not only an anti-proliferative effect but also in anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic effects in tumor cells. Recently potent small-molecule inhibitors targeting the components of the ERK pathway have been developed. Among them, BAY 43-9006 (Raf inhibitor), and PD184352, PD0325901 and ARRY-142886 (MEK1/2 inhibitors) have reached the clinical trial stage. We briefly discuss the possibility that combination of ERK pathway inhibitors (cytostatic agents) and conventional anticancer drugs (cytotoxic agents) provides an excellent basis for the development of new chemotherapeutic strategies against cancer.},

Usage of visualization in decision making carries some elements of subjectivity. In addition, people's decisions are often biased in favor of their proposed hypotheses. The objectives of this paper were to examine the biases in using sequence logo as an evaluation metric for transcription factor analysis and identify some critical weaknesses in sequence logo for possible future improvements. Document analysis and subject matter expert interviews method were used for information gathering. We found that sequence logo has been frequently misused to support the results obtained from computational transcription factor analysis. In addition, we suggest that current sequence logo can be improved in several aspects to support various users' needs and minimize elements of subjectivity in decision making.},

In p44 MAPK-/- thymocytes, proliferation in response to activation with a monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate was severely reduced even though activation of p42 MAPK was more sustained in these cells.

  abstract = {A hallmark of a plethora of intracellular signaling pathways is the spatial separation of activation and deactivation processes that potentially results in precipitous gradients of activated proteins. The classical metabolic control analysis (MCA), which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a system variable as the control coefficient, cannot be applied to spatially separated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that govern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially heterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of control summation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the classical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying concentrations. In this generalization, the process of diffusion, which enters as the result of spatial concentration gradients, plays a role similar to other processes such as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The second summation theorem is completely novel. It states that the control by the membrane transport, the diffusion control coefficient multiplied by two, and a newly introduced control coefficient associated with changes in the spatial size of a system (e.g., cell), all add up to one and zero for the control over flux and concentration. Using a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system in a spherical cell, we speculate that unless active mechanisms of intracellular transport are involved, the threshold cell size is limited by the diffusion control, when it is beginning to exceed the spatial control coefficient significantly.},

Findings suggest that neither the health benefits envisioned by DTC-GT proponents (e.g., significant improvements in positive health behaviors) nor the worst fears expressed by its critics (e.g., catastrophic psychological distress and misunderstanding of test results, undue burden on the health care system) have materialized to date. However, research in this area is in its early stages and possesses numerous key limitations.

Such data sets are becoming extremely large and thus taxing current visualization paradigms. Sequence Logos represent consensus sequences but have limitations for protein alignments. As an alternative, ProfileGrids are a new protein sequence alignment visualization paradigm that represents an alignment as a color-coded matrix of the residue frequency occurring at every homologous position in the aligned protein family.
Results: The JProfileGrid software program was used to analyze the BioVis contest data sets to generate figures for comparison with the Sequence Logo reference images.
Conclusions: The ProfileGrid representation allows for the clear and effective analysis of protein multiple sequence alignments. This includes both a general overview of the conservation and diversity sequence patterns as well as the interactive ability to query the details of the protein residue distributions in the alignment. The JProfileGrid software is free and available from www.ProfileGrid.org.},

As part of a multistage, interdisciplinary project, an online survey (Stage 2 of the Genioz study) was available from May 2016 to May 2017. In total, 3253 respondents attempted the survey, with 2395 completed Australian responses from people with and without experience of having a PGT: 72\% were female; 59\% of the whole sample were undertaking/or had a university education; and, overall, age ranged from 18\textemdash{}over 80. A total of 571 respondents reported having had a genetic test, 373 of these classifiable as a PGT. A bivariate analysis suggests people who have undergone PGT in our sample were: women aged 25 and over; or in a high socioeconomic group, or have a personal or family diagnosis of a genetic condition (P {$\leq$} 0.03). After a multivariate analysis, socioeconomic status and a genetic condition in the family were not of significance. The most common types of PGT reported were for carrier status and ancestry. Findings suggest greater awareness of, and an increasing demand for nonhealth related PGT in Australia. To support both consumers and health care professionals with understanding PGT results, there is a need for appropriate support and resources.},

  abstract = {A powerful technique for analyzing DNA and protein sequences, the sequence logo, is now available to researchers. The authors explain sequence logos, to show their usefulness for biological and linguistic research, and to encourage their use by others. A sequence logo is a graphic representation of the amount of information to be found in a set of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This method has advantages over the conventional method of creating a consensus. For example, a logo of DNA shows all the bases found in the binding site of a protein, indicates how much each base is conserved, and depicts the location of the conservation with respect to the major and minor grooves of the DNA.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {In the present work, the potential use of several antioxidant and detoxification biomarkers in the digestive gland of wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) for biomonitoring the marine pollution induced by the Don Pedro oil spill has been investigated. Two locations from the East to South-East of Eivissa (Ibiza) and Formentera islands were selected, one extensively affected by the oil spill and the other one not affected and considered as the control area. Mussels were sampled one, two and six months after the Don Pedro accident. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels were significantly increased in the soft tissues of mussels in the affected area one month after the disaster, returning to normal values after six months. Markers of oxidative damage in lipids \textendash{} malondialdehyde, and in proteins \textendash{} carbonyl derivates, and antioxidant enzyme \textendash{} catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, activities significantly increased as result of the spill oil after one month, returning to basal values at two month sampling time. Glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio (GSH/GSSG), as a marker of the redox status, was reduced after one and two months indicating a more oxidized situation. Markers of detoxification \textendash{} glutathione-Stransferase and cytochrome P4501A activities and metallothionein gene expression \textendash{} were significantly increased by the oil spill one month after the accident, returning to the basal values at two month sampling time. In conclusion, the Don Pedro accident induced a transient situation of PAHs pollution resulting in enhanced antioxidant and detoxification defense systems in the wild mussel M. galloprovincialis returning to normal levels six months from the spill. The selected biomarkers are a useful tool for biomonitoring the response to acute exposure to pollutants in marine mussels.},

  abstract = {There is increasing demand from the public for direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, and the US Food and Drug Administration limits the type of health-related claims DTC tests can market. Some DTC companies provide raw genotyping data to customers if requested, and these raw data may include variants occurring in genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics to be reported as incidental/secondary findings. The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of requests for clinical confirmation of DTC results that were received by our laboratory and to analyze variant classification concordance. We identified 49 patient samples received for further testing that had previously identified genetic variants reported in DTC raw data. For each case identified, information pertaining to the outcome of clinical confirmation testing as well as classification of the DTC variant was collected and analyzed. Our analyses indicated that 40\% of variants in a variety of genes reported in DTC raw data were false positives. In addition, some variants designated with the ``increased risk'' classification in DTC raw data or by a third-party interpretation service were classified as benign at Ambry Genetics as well as several other clinical laboratories, and are noted to be common variants in publicly available population frequency databases. Our results demonstrate the importance of confirming DTC raw data variants in a clinical laboratory that is well versed in both complex variant detection and classification.},

Disgruntled customers, clinicians, and government officials became concerned about the accuracy of the tests, the privacy of customer data, and the health consequences of the DTC approach. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) believed the test kits and genetic reports fell into the medical device category and required agency approval to market them. 23andMe ignored FDA warnings about its unauthorized DTC approach and the FDA ordered 23andMe to stop the service. The CEO suspended its genetic reporting service but continued to market test kits and ancestry reports to emphasize the mission and business model. Students are asked to assess the CEO's reactions in early 2014 from the viewpoint of her leadership approach, assess the legal, ethical, and marketing impact of her previous decisions, and propose improvements.},

One of the four main sub-groups, the p38 group of MAP kinases, serve as a nexus for signal transduction and play a vital role in numerous biological processes. In this review, we highlight the known characteristics and components of the p38 pathway along with the mechanism and consequences of p38 activation. We focus on the role of p38 as a signal transduction mediator and examine the evidence linking p38 to inflammation, cell cycle, cell death, development, cell differentiation, senescence and tumorigenesis in specific cell types. Upstream and downstream components of p38 are described and questions remaining to be answered are posed. Finally, we propose several directions for future research on p38.},

Bit coin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial \textendash{} they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to block chains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},
