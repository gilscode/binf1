  abstract = {Background: Sequence logo plots have become a standard graphical tool for visualizing sequence motifs in DNA, RNA or protein sequences. However standard logo plots primarily highlight enrichment of symbols, and may fail to highlight interesting depletions. Current alternatives that try to highlight depletion often produce visually cluttered logos.
Results: We introduce a new sequence logo plot, the EDLogo plot, that highlights both enrichment and depletion, while minimizing visual clutter. We provide an easy-to-use and highly customizable R package Logolas to produce a range of logo plots, including EDLogo plots. This software also allows elements in the logo plot to be strings of characters, rather than a single character, extending the range of applications beyond the usual DNA, RNA or protein sequences. And the software includes new Empirical Bayes methods to stabilize estimates of enrichment and depletion, and thus better highlight the most significant patterns in data. We illustrate our methods and software on applications to transcription factor binding site motifs, protein sequence alignments and cancer mutation signature profiles.
Conclusions: Our new EDLogo plots and flexible software implementation can help data analysts visualize both enrichment and depletion of characters (DNA sequence bases, amino acids, etc.) across a wide range of applications.},

            This work assesses relationships for 30 complete prokaryotic genomes between the presence of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and other gene features, including expression levels, type of start codon, and distance between successive genes. A significant positive correlation of the presence of an SD sequence and the predicted expression level of a gene based on codon usage biases was ascertained, such that predicted highly expressed genes are more likely to possess a strong SD sequence than average genes. Genes with AUG start codons are more likely than genes with other start codons, GUG or UUG, to possess an SD sequence. Genes in close proximity to upstream genes on the same coding strand in most genomes are significantly higher in SD presence. In light of these results, we discuss the role of the SD sequence in translation initiation and its relationship with predicted gene expression levels and with operon structure in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.},

Usage of visualization in decision making carries some elements of subjectivity. In addition, people's decisions are often biased in favor of their proposed hypotheses. The objectives of this paper were to examine the biases in using sequence logo as an evaluation metric for transcription factor analysis and identify some critical weaknesses in sequence logo for possible future improvements. Document analysis and subject matter expert interviews method were used for information gathering. We found that sequence logo has been frequently misused to support the results obtained from computational transcription factor analysis. In addition, we suggest that current sequence logo can be improved in several aspects to support various users' needs and minimize elements of subjectivity in decision making.},

This paper describes a user study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of sequence logo as evaluation metric for motif prediction tools. We also investigate the nature of confirmation biases in using sequence logos in result reporting in publications. While sequence logos have been widely used for visualizing sequence motifs in the past 20 years, no study has reported its effectiveness and possible misuses in decision making. We conducted a paper-and-pencil test to determine the effectiveness of sequence logos in some of their common usages. A survey study was also performed to investigate sequence logos' learn ability. We found that there are great mismatches between users' perception and actual quality of motifs when sequence logos were used as an evaluation metric. Therefore, evaluation of motif prediction tools based on sequence logos has to be interpreted cautiously. Our result also suggests that there are still room for improvements in the current sequence logo's layout design.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple sequence alignments are a fundamental tool for the comparative analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. However, large data sets are no longer manageable for visualization and investigation using the traditional stacked sequence alignment representation.
Results: We introduce ProfileGrids that represent a multiple sequence alignment as a matrix color-coded according to the residue frequency occurring at each column position. JProfileGrid is a Java application for computing and analyzing ProfileGrids. A dynamic interaction with the alignment information is achieved by changing the ProfileGrid color scheme, by extracting sequence subsets at selected residues of interest, and by relating alignment information to residue physical properties. Conserved family motifs can be identified by the overlay of similarity plot calculations on a ProfileGrid. Figures suitable for publication can be generated from the saved spreadsheet output of the colored matrices as well as by the export of conservation information for use in the PyMOL molecular visualization program. We demonstrate the utility of ProfileGrids on 300 bacterial homologs of the RecA family – a universally conserved protein involved in DNA recombination and repair. Careful attention was paid to curating the collected RecA sequences since ProfileGrids allow the easy identification of rare residues in an alignment. We relate the RecA alignment sequence conservation to the following three topics: the recently identified DNA binding residues, the unexplored MAW motif, and a unique Bacillus subtilis RecA homolog sequence feature.
Conclusion: ProfileGrids allow large protein families to be visualized more effectively than the traditional stacked sequence alignment form. This new graphical representation facilitates the determination of the sequence conservation at residue positions of interest, enables the examination of structural patterns by using residue physical properties, and permits the display of rare sequence features within the context of an entire alignment. JProfileGrid is free for noncommercial use and is available from http://www.profilegrid.org. Furthermore, we present a curated RecA protein collection that is more diverse than previous data sets; and, therefore, this RecA ProfileGrid is a rich source of information for nanoanatomy analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: The 2013 BioVis Contest provided an opportunity to evaluate different paradigms for visualizing protein multiple sequence alignments. Such data sets are becoming extremely large and thus taxing current visualization paradigms. Sequence Logos represent consensus sequences but have limitations for protein alignments. As an alternative, ProfileGrids are a new protein sequence alignment visualization paradigm that represents an alignment as a color-coded matrix of the residue frequency occurring at every homologous position in the aligned protein family.
Results: The JProfileGrid software program was used to analyze the BioVis contest data sets to generate figures for comparison with the Sequence Logo reference images.
Conclusions: The ProfileGrid representation allows for the clear and effective analysis of protein multiple sequence alignments. This includes both a general overview of the conservation and diversity sequence patterns as well as the interactive ability to query the details of the protein residue distributions in the alignment. The JProfileGrid software is free and available from www.ProfileGrid.org.},
