  abstract = {Background: Sequence logo plots have become a standard graphical tool for visualizing sequence motifs in DNA, RNA or protein sequences. However standard logo plots primarily highlight enrichment of symbols, and may fail to highlight interesting depletions. Current alternatives that try to highlight depletion often produce visually cluttered logos.
Results: We introduce a new sequence logo plot, the EDLogo plot, that highlights both enrichment and depletion, while minimizing visual clutter. We provide an easy-to-use and highly customizable R package Logolas to produce a range of logo plots, including EDLogo plots. This software also allows elements in the logo plot to be strings of characters, rather than a single character, extending the range of applications beyond the usual DNA, RNA or protein sequences. And the software includes new Empirical Bayes methods to stabilize estimates of enrichment and depletion, and thus better highlight the most significant patterns in data. We illustrate our methods and software on applications to transcription factor binding site motifs, protein sequence alignments and cancer mutation signature profiles.
Conclusions: Our new EDLogo plots and flexible software implementation can help data analysts visualize both enrichment and depletion of characters (DNA sequence bases, amino acids, etc.) across a wide range of applications.},

This paper describes a user study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of sequence logo as evaluation metric for motif prediction tools. We also investigate the nature of confirmation biases in using sequence logos in result reporting in publications. While sequence logos have been widely used for visualizing sequence motifs in the past 20 years, no study has reported its effectiveness and possible misuses in decision making. We conducted a paper-and-pencil test to determine the effectiveness of sequence logos in some of their common usages. A survey study was also performed to investigate sequence logos' learn ability. We found that there are great mismatches between users' perception and actual quality of motifs when sequence logos were used as an evaluation metric. Therefore, evaluation of motif prediction tools based on sequence logos has to be interpreted cautiously. Our result also suggests that there are still room for improvements in the current sequence logo's layout design.},

Usage of visualization in decision making carries some elements of subjectivity. In addition, people's decisions are often biased in favor of their proposed hypotheses. The objectives of this paper were to examine the biases in using sequence logo as an evaluation metric for transcription factor analysis and identify some critical weaknesses in sequence logo for possible future improvements. Document analysis and subject matter expert interviews method were used for information gathering. We found that sequence logo has been frequently misused to support the results obtained from computational transcription factor analysis. In addition, we suggest that current sequence logo can be improved in several aspects to support various users' needs and minimize elements of subjectivity in decision making.},

            This work assesses relationships for 30 complete prokaryotic genomes between the presence of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and other gene features, including expression levels, type of start codon, and distance between successive genes. A significant positive correlation of the presence of an SD sequence and the predicted expression level of a gene based on codon usage biases was ascertained, such that predicted highly expressed genes are more likely to possess a strong SD sequence than average genes. Genes with AUG start codons are more likely than genes with other start codons, GUG or UUG, to possess an SD sequence. Genes in close proximity to upstream genes on the same coding strand in most genomes are significantly higher in SD presence. In light of these results, we discuss the role of the SD sequence in translation initiation and its relationship with predicted gene expression levels and with operon structure in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.},

  abstract = {Background: The 2013 BioVis Contest provided an opportunity to evaluate different paradigms for visualizing protein multiple sequence alignments. Such data sets are becoming extremely large and thus taxing current visualization paradigms. Sequence Logos represent consensus sequences but have limitations for protein alignments. As an alternative, ProfileGrids are a new protein sequence alignment visualization paradigm that represents an alignment as a color-coded matrix of the residue frequency occurring at every homologous position in the aligned protein family.
Results: The JProfileGrid software program was used to analyze the BioVis contest data sets to generate figures for comparison with the Sequence Logo reference images.
Conclusions: The ProfileGrid representation allows for the clear and effective analysis of protein multiple sequence alignments. This includes both a general overview of the conservation and diversity sequence patterns as well as the interactive ability to query the details of the protein residue distributions in the alignment. The JProfileGrid software is free and available from www.ProfileGrid.org.},

The authors explain sequence logos, to show their usefulness for biological and linguistic research, and to encourage their use by others. A sequence logo is a graphic representation of the amount of information to be found in a set of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This method has advantages over the conventional method of creating a consensus. For example, a logo of DNA shows all the bases found in the binding site of a protein, indicates how much each base is conserved, and depicts the location of the conservation with respect to the major and minor grooves of the DNA.{$<>$}},
