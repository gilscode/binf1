\section{Introduction}

Sequence logos were first introduced by Schneider and Stephens in 1999 and presented a graphic representation of consensus sequences. In the original paper, the authors considered that consensus sequences do not fully represent all the information in the sequences, considering that those only show the most frequent bases, and often many other bases appear at a significant frequency \cite{schneider1999}.
